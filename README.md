# GoogleUdacity - Google Developer Challenge Scholarship

The scholarship program is structured in two parts:  

#### Phase 1: Challenge Scholarships  

The first phase of this scholarship provides 3-months of access to one of four Udacity courses: Intro to HTML + CSS, Offline Web Applications, Android Basics and Developing Android Apps. Scholarship recipients in these courses will receive a robust community experience supported by dedicated Community Managers, Udacity mentor support, and a chance to qualify for a full Nanodegree scholarship.  

After the 3-months, full scholarships will be awarded to students based on the progress in Phase 1 and their contributions to the Udacity community.
