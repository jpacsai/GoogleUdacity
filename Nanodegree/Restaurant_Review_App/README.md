# Restaurant Reviews App üçï
**This project is developed for Google/Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree (Project 6).**

The aim of the project was to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application by taking a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use as well as converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.
