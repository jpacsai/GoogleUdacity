# Cat Clicker App - premium edition pro üò∫

**Developed for Udacity Nanodegree course**  

The aim of the project is to practice how to structure a web application with potential for future upgrades.
Built by adding extra features to [Cat Clicker premium](https://jpacsai.github.io/GoogleUdacity_Nanodegree/Nanodegree/Cat_Clicker/Premium_Edition/dist/).

When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area updates to show the data for the selected cat.
The number of clicks in the cat area is unique to each cat, and increments when the cat's picture is clicked.

There is an admin form included in the page too to update the details of the cats.
