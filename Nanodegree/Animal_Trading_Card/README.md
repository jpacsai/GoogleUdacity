# Animal Trading Card Project - Lesson 10

**This project is developed for Google/Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree (Project 1).**  

The aim of the project was to create a card with HTML and CSS while fulfilling the project [criteria](https://github.com/jpacsai/GoogleUdacity_Nanodegree/blob/master/Nanodegree/Animal_Trading_Card/Criteria.md)

The card contains an animated, drawn image which I have created only with CSS. The background color changes too as the day and night alternate.
