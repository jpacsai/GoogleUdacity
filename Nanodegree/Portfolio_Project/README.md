# Portfolio

**This project is developed for Google/Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree (Project 2).**

The aim of the project was to build a portfolio website with the provided design [mockup](https://github.com/jpacsai/GoogleUdacity_Nanodegree/blob/master/Nanodegree/Portfolio_Project/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) as a PDF-file, which must be replicated
in HTML and CSS. The finished product is a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the 
portfolio projects I complete through the course of the Nanodegree program.

I choose to create an office desk "scene" with a computer displaying the Udacity page and a VS Code Editor along with some books to practice CSS
and I have added some features with JavaScript to the page (wall clock, steaming coffee mug) to add an extra layer of interest.
