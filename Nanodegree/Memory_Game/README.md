# Memory Game Project 🃏

**This project is developed for Google/Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree (Project 2).**

A responsive memory game where the user is presented 16 cards (8 pairs of 2) and has to match them 2 at a time.

The aim of the project is to implement the following functionalities:
- Flipping cards
- What happens when cards match
- What happens when cards do not match
- When the game finishes
